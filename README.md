# Prediction the risk of prostate cancer
My research work on prediction the risk of prostate cancer using information technologies

## Short description:

<ins>site.html</ins> and <ins>count_try_ajax.html</ins> describe two main pages of site

<ins>count_cgi.py</ins> gets completed form from <ins>count_try_ajax.html</ins> and sends input to <ins>test_count_cgi.py</ins> to get results

main calculations take place in <ins>test_count_cgi.py</ins>, <ins>regressor_cgi.py</ins>, <ins>classificator_cgi.py</ins> and <ins>keras_cgi.py</ins> files

conditions of cancer stages are in <ins>count_degree_cgi.py</ins>

<ins>statistical_analysis.py</ins> conducts statistical analysis of data

## Approaches considered:

- Regression
- Classification
- Keras neural networks

## Main requirements:
Python 3.6 and earlier
